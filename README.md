Welcome to PyTorchAudio, a project designed to demonstrate audio processing and deep learning using the PyTorch framework. This repository showcases how to preprocess audio data, build and train neural networks, and perform tasks like sound classification using the torchaudio library.

Features

Audio Preprocessing:
Resampling, mixing down channels, and Mel Spectrogram generation.
Custom Dataset:
Loading and managing the UrbanSound8K dataset with PyTorch Dataset and DataLoader.
Deep Learning Models:
Implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for audio classification.
Training and Evaluation:
Training scripts with loss tracking, model saving, and prediction testing.
